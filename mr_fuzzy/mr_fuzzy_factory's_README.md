### This project focuses on the first three years of the factory's activity and provides key metrics and insights to show and predict the growth and improvement of the company.


Established in March 2012, Mr. Fuzzy is a stuffed animals factory that produced four products in their first three years of activity: 

Product one "Mr. Fuzzy" launched in March 2012.
Product two "Love Bear" launched in January 2013.
Product three "Sugar Panda" launched in December 2013.
Product four "Mini Bear" launched in February 2014.

I based my project on five aspects:

The first aspect focuses on the annual revenue by product, to get an ovelook on the business.
The second aspect focuses on whether products were often bought together with other products?
The third aspect focuses on the website traffic and the marketing source users commenly used.
The fourth aspect focuses on the device type used to click on ads.
The fifth aspect focuses on business oppeturnities to increase growth?

I analyzed Mr. Fuzzy Factory dataset with SQL and Tableau to get some insoights from the data and create the dashboards below.



**My Conclusions:**

- The four products added a consistent revenue growth since 2012 by attracting more clients to buy one or more products.
- The analysis presents the effectiveness of "gsearch" and "brand search" marketing sources, therefore the company should consider focusing on these two channels as the companies main marketing sources.
- The marketing source "bsearch" future investment should be monitored and reconsidered.
- “Mr. Fuzzy” brand became popular, and more clients are now searching for the brand directly in the search engine. Therefore the company might be able to decrease marketing expenses in the near future.
- The factory should decide to either focus on desktop users ads or find a better source to increase mobile device users activity.
- The new page lander-1 showcases effectiveness over homepage and therefore the factory should consider replacing homepage with lander-1 page.


As a further investigation I would probably get a deeper look on each website page to reduce dropout sessions by creating new pages and confirming improvement with an AB testing.



**This dashboard provides an overview on ![the factory's annual revenue]([https://example.com/path/to/your/dashboard/screenshot.png](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/serach.mayerfeld/viz/ProductsDashboardbyYear/ProductsByYearDashboard?publish=yes) since 2012 , as a key metric to monitor performance:**



- The first product the company published was "Mr. Fuzzy". This product provided a stable revenue growth over the years.
 
- In 2013, the company launched the products "Love Bear" and "Sugar Panda", and in 2014, "Mini Bear".

- Product 1 "Mr. Fuzzy" bought often together with product 3 "Sugar Panda", whereas Product 2 "Love Bear" and Product 4 "Mini Bear" often bought together with Product 1 "Mr. Fuzzy".

  
**The following dashboard showcases the [website traffic source and device type](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/serach.mayerfeld/viz/ChannelSourceandDeviceTypeDashboard/MarketingInvestmentInvestigationDashboard?publish=yes) used by sessions:**

The top graph showcases the conversion rate of the website traffic source by order:

- The marketing sources "gsearch" and "brand search" have a consistent growth of 'session to order' conversion rate since 2012. 
-  The marketing source "bsearch" 'session to order' conversion rate, decreased in 2014 as opposed to 2013. 
- The marketing source "organic search" 'session to order' conversion rate growth consistently increased since 2012. This proves the fact that “Mr. Fuzzy” brand became popular, and more clients are now searching for the brand directly in the search engine. 
 
The bottom graph focuses on the device type sessions used in channel "gsearch":

- Both sections, "Sessions" and "Orders", showcase a consistent website activity growth for desktop users vs mobile device since 2012. 

  
The following [AB testing](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/serach.mayerfeld/viz/HomeandLanderPagesABTestingDashboard/ABTestingHomeLanderandShippingPagesDashboard?publish=yes) focuses on whether the new "Lander-1” page attracts more sessions to click through next page vs "Home" page.

- This Tableau dashboard showcases the fact that an increase of click through "Lander-1” page rate effects directly the revenue growth.  

 

Working on this dataset provided me with some insights regarding the business. For instance; Which product has high demand? Whether the company is profitable or not? How can we rationalize the sessions process to increase revenue? Each dashboard displayed different insights that led me to the conclusions above. By following my recommendations, the factory can rationalize the business and therefore see an increase of their monthly revenue.
